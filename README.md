The goal of this app is to include every functional and useful settings page and intent on the Quest OS\
Currently up to date as of v37

Special thanks to [basti564](https://github.com/basti564) for reverse engineering vrshell intents. This app essentially serves as a a combined, user-friendly interface for the Android Settings App (which is very limited on the Quest) and [basti564/vrLauncher](https://github.com/basti564/vrLauncher)

## Current Functionality
 - Set brightness to 0 (Quest UI limits range from 16 to 100)
 - Open the hidden full room setup guardian menu (with explaination)
 - Guided setup for Private DNS, with a list of popular servers, including ad-blockers (Adblock in all apps!)
 - Link to Night Light settings pane, allowing schedules to be easily set
 - Link to Date and Time settings, allowing clock to be changed
 - Link to App Settings, allowing apps to be killed and app data/cache to be wiped
 - Link to Android's accessibility settings. High contrast text and mono audio work
 - Link to Device Info, showing build numbers and allowing you to change the device name for bluetooth

All of these features exist, but are inaccessible within the Quest UI
